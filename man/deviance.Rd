\title{\code{deviance} returns the deviance based on the conditional likelihood associated with the survival part.}
\usage{
deviance(object, M = 1000, conditional = "survival", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object inheriting from class 'Bqrjm'.}

\item{M}{an integer indicating the number of draws used for the approximation of the integral with respect to random effects, M=1000 by default.}

\item{conditional}{is "survival" by default (only this one is implemented until now).}

\item{verbose}{A logical indicating if information about method's progress (included progress bars for each step) must be printed (default to TRUE). Adds a small extra overload.}
}
\value{
An object which is a list with the following elements:
\describe{
\item{\code{deviance}}{Numerical object returning the deviance}
\item{\code{likelihood}}{(Conditional) likelihood}
\item{\code{sims.list}}{list of individual quantities as likelihood, draws of random effects, hazard and survival functions}
\item{\code{control}}{list of arguments giving details about the deviance}
}
}
\description{
\code{deviance} returns the deviance based on the conditional likelihood associated with the survival part.
